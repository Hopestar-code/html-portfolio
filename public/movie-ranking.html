<h1>The best movies according to Hopestar</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Prison Break</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie action. It shows me how strong the brain can create bigger plans.</p>
<h3>Young Sheldon</h3>
<p>A great interesting series. It taught me how well spoken you can be when you're a genius and the influence you can have to people.</p>
<h3>Jumanji</h3>
<p>A must never miss movie that is designed for everyone to watch. A tv game turned into reality.</p>
