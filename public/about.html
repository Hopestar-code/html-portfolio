<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Hope Mathebula, a web developer based in South Africa. With over 2 years of experience, i specialize in creating websites, making applications that simplify people's lives and also learning more about cybersecurity.</p>

<p>When i'm not in front of the desktop, you'll find me at the gym working out, travelling, going out to eat healthy food, reading books and finding new information about programming.</p>

<p>My passion for software developing extends beyond my work, as i enjoy enrolling at institutions that teach more about softwares and cloud migration. I also spend most of my time attending endless courses and lectures that deal with artificial intelligence and coding.</p>
